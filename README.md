*All due credits go to [Chris Oliver](https://twitter.com/excid3), my Ruby on Rails sensei.*

**TweetScheduler** is a web app that sends out scheduled Twitter tweets. 

It was built using the following technologies:
- Ruby 3.1.2
- Rails 7.0.3
- PostgreSQL 14.2, a more powerful database vs Rails' default SQLite
- Bootstrap 5, for quick and responsive front-end design
- Sidekiq, for background jobs
- Twitter API
